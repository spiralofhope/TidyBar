# I have left the game

I have left the game and this AddOn is no longer maintained; feel free to fork it.  I'm leaving things as they are so you can chat with one another via the issue ticketing system.



# TidyBar

A 
[World of Warcraft](http://blog.spiralofhope.com/?p=2987)

# Installation

Since it's a regular addon, it's manually installed the same as every other addon would be.

1) [Download TidyBar](https://github.com/spiralofhope/TidyBar/releases) 

2) Extract it to your `Interface\AddOns` folder.

Perhaps your game is installed to one of:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft` <br />
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (x86)` 

.. and so you would extract the contents of your downloaded archive to something like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` 

.. and so you would end up with the folder 

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\TidyBar`

.. and inside it would have `TidyBar.lua` and all the other files.

# Configuration / Usage

- `Interface > Addons > TidyBar` will give a number of options.
- By default, `shift-up` / `shift-down` will change your actionbar.  TidyBar will force-update itself when it sees this.
- `TidyBar\extras\hotkeys on main buttons` has instructions for putting text on empty buttons.


# Issues and suggestions

([issues list](https://github.com/spiralofhope/TidyBar/issues))

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like [TekErr](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681).
