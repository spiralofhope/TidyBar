# 8.x - Battle for Azeroth (BfA)


## UNRELEASED retail 8.3.7.2, classic 1.13.3

- Fixed some .toc text.
- Make the backpack order the same as what's displayed in AddOns like ArkInventory.


## retail 8.3.7.1, classic 1.13.2

- Tested for Shadowlands beta 9.0.2.36086
- Fixed an in-combat error.
- No longer hiding a popup nag, as that's not compatible with Shadowlands and it's not this AddOn's job anyway.


## retail 8.3.0.1, classic 1.13.1

- Implemented dual retail-classic support.
  -  I'm not going to maintain a totally separate addon for classic because that would be annoying.  This is a simple enough addon that I can manage this.


## 8.3.0.0

- TOC bump



## 8.2.5.0

- TOC bump

 
## 8.2.0.2

- Minor code audit and cleanup.
- Slightly widened the reveal region for the side bars area; when the mouse approaches the side, the buttons will show sooner.


## 8.2.0.1

- Removed TidyBar-specific main area frame, now attaching to the world frame to solve a SetPoint() error.



## 8.1.0.1

- Move the hidden `PetActionBarFrame` so it's hidden frame is not overtop of everything.


## 8.1.0.0

- TOC bump



## 8.0.1.9

- Implemented a hackish workaround for #67 - Implement StatusTrackingBarManager functionality


## 8.0.1.8

- Fix an in-combat error from `MainMenuBar:SetWidth()`


## 8.0.1.7

- Hide the background/side styling of the `ExtraActionButton`


## 8.0.1.6

- Styling the power bar area.


## 8.0.1.5

- Entirely removed objectives tracker code.
  -  I don't understand what parts to manipulate.


## 8.0.1.4

- Fixed the objectives tracker code, again.


## 8.0.1.3

- Fixed parts of the objectives tracker being constantly removed.
  -  This unintentionally fixed the positioning of the multi-seat vehicle UI (e.g. the Grand Expedition Yak).


## 8.0.1.2

- Stacked the pet bar.
- Shifted a hidden bar that was preventing mouseover and clicking in part of the chat area.


## 8.0.1.1

- Major rewrite
  -  Not just a rewrite for 8.x, but a general code audit and simplification.  TidyBar is now easier to maintain.  Probably.
- Hardening
  -  When WoW is updated, and as the API changes (and addons break), TidyBar will try to avoid "exploding with errors", and will offer suggestions for maintainers.
- Fixed the main area positioning code.
- Old experience, honor and artifact power code was removed.
  -  Blizzard made a combined bar, and it's stuck underneath the main buttons.  I don't understand it well enough to move it around.  It really does act different.
  -  As there was some hackery to fix a "wiggle" issue, related code removal slightly reduces some CPU load.
  -  Bar height functionality removed.  I don't use it, and that code wasn't very happy.
  -  Bar spacing removed.  It wasn't working all that well in the first place; I couldn't fix it properly, and I never even used it.
- Removed show/hide the main bar background.
  -  Blizzard has made this one large texture.  As I don't know how to deal with it, I'll revisit this in the future.
  -  See also #68 - Implement main bar texture
  -  See also #49 - Implement bars texture changing
- Partially-fixed #30 - Hide global cooldowns in sidebar, when hidden-on-mouseout
- Gryphons have been hidden
  -  See #70 - Re-implement gryphon functionality
- Mostly-implemented #60 - Main bar vertical positioning
  -  See also #69 - Implement a better maximum y position



# 7.x - Legion



## 7.3.2.0

- TOC bump


## 7.3.0.1

- TOC bump



## 7.2.5.1

- Fixed #58 - Move pet bar
  -  It's now positioned the same as the main bar.
  -  These could be made to be configured independently, but I'm not going to bother.
- The pet battle UI is now scaled the same as the main bar.
  -  These could be made to be configured independently, but I'm not going to bother.
- The pet battle UI now has its background textures shown/hidden the same as the main bar.
  -  These could be made to be configured independently, but I'm not going to bother.


## 7.2.0.5

- Hide the FPS text (FramerateText).


## 7.2.0.4

- Fixed #57 - Move FPS meter


## 7.2.0.3

- Vehicle support
  -  It's hardcoded, but seems to be a reasonable default for me.  People with a chat box on the right are screwed.  Same with the pet UI.


## 7.2.0.2

- Fixed the pet battle UI.


## 7.2.0.1

- Fixed #43 and #54 related to the bars resetting and repositioning under certain circumstances.
- Fixed the feature to show/hide macro text on buttons.
- Implemented bar height customization.
- Thinned-down the vehicle health and power bars.
- Fixed #50 - Fix jumping main area
- Fixed the side not toggling correctly when set/unset in the options panel.
- General code clarity improvements.
- For code clarity, references to "sidebar" have been renamed "side".
  -  Users who wish to once again hide the "sidebar" on mouseout will have to enable this renamed preference in the options panel.
- Style improvements to the options panel code.
  -  Yes, these things matter.
- Removed old code from the original author(s).
  -  I's been commented-out for some time now, to check if it would be missed.  That code is no longer, or was never, needed.  Probably.
- I think TidyBar may have been broken for users who were not max level.


## 7.1.0.1

- Fixed an unpredictable error message when first logging in.



## 7.0.3.23

- Implemented a debugging mode.
  -  Prints out various messages of interest to developers.
- Fixed #27 - Right-hand mainbar alignment.

- Implemented an option to show/hide the HonorWatchBar.

- Fixed #41 - Fix reputation bar when at max-xp
- Fixed #26 - Fix artifact experience bar backdrop

- Fixed the horizontal movement for the main area.


## 7.0.3.19

- Fixed the positioning of the ArtifactWatchBar.
- Fixed the text of the ArtifactWatchBar appearing at startup, until refreshed or the mouse is moved through it.
- Removed the reputation bar functionality.
  -  As of 22522, I've learned that the "reputation as experience bar" feature is gone, though the checkbox still exists in the UI.
  -  I don't know if the UI needs to be updated, or if the feature will return in some form.  I'm guessing the former.

- Rework bar alignment for style and speed.

- When `TidyBar_options.show_experience_bar = true`, keep the experience text hidden (when various character interfaces are shown).
- Fixed #21 - Fix reputation bar height when max experience
  -  Okay, so maybe it's not so easy to fix these things..

- Fixed #28 - Immediately hide the sidebar when the option is enabled
- Fixed #29 - Improve sidebar mousein showing

Earlier than this, I had hacked on TidyBar here and there.

(no notes were taken)

I had hacked on TidyBar here and there.



# Earlier authors' notes

The following notes were by the original author.

# 5.x - Mists of Pandaria (MoP)


## 5.2

- Added the Store button to the Tidy Bar container so it gets hidden properly.


## 5.1

- TOC Bump


## 5.0

- Update to 5.x TOC
- Added `HideMainButtonArt` and `HideExperienceBar` variables to the head of `TidyBar.lua`; Setting the variable to `true` will make the changes.

## 4.9

- Update to 4.3 TOC


## 4.8

Presumably this AddOn didn't exist before the 4.2 update that was mentioned last.
